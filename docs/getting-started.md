# Getting started

Kariz joins two servers with a tunnel:

- The **entry** is the public server your users connect to. It owns the `[[forward]]`
  rules: "whatever arrives on this port, send it to that address".
- The **exit** is the server that reaches the real targets. It dials the addresses the
  entry asks for.

    U[Users] -->|port 443| E[Entry server]
    E <==>|Kariz tunnel| X[Exit server]
    X --> T[Targets]
```

Which side opens the tunnel is the **mode**:

| Mode | Who dials | Pick it when |
|---|---|---|
| `reverse` | the exit dials the entry | the entry can take incoming connections from the exit |
| `direct` | the entry dials the exit | the exit can take incoming connections (or sits behind a CDN) |

The dialing side sets `tunnel.remote`, the other side `tunnel.listen`.

## The quick way

The manager script does every step below for you, including a systemd service per
tunnel and the command to run on the other server:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erfan-XRay/Kariz/main/scripts/kariz.sh)
```

See [The manager script](manager.md). The rest of this page is the same thing by hand.

## 1. Install

Download the static Linux binary (x86_64) from
[Releases](https://github.com/Erfan-XRay/Kariz/releases), or build it with Rust 1.80 or
newer:

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/kariz /usr/local/bin/
```

Do this on both servers.

## 2. Make a token

```bash
kariz token
```

The token is the tunnel's only secret: both sides use the same one, and anyone who has
it can use the tunnel. It never travels over the network.

## 3. Write the two configs

Start from a pair in [`configs/`](../configs):

| Pair | Setup |
|---|---|
| `entry-reverse.toml`, `exit-reverse.toml` | reverse mode over plain `tcp` |
| `entry-direct.toml`, `exit-direct.toml` | direct mode over plain `tcp` |
| `entry-tcpmux-reverse.toml`, `exit-tcpmux-reverse.toml` | reverse mode with mux |
| `entry-udp-reverse.toml`, `exit-udp-reverse.toml` | UDP forwarding (WireGuard, games) |
| `entry-wss-direct.toml`, `exit-wss-direct.toml` | `wss` to your own server, self-signed certificate pinned |
| `entry-wss-cdn.toml`, `exit-wss-cdn.toml` | `wss` through a CDN ([guide](CDN.md)) |
| `entry-quic-direct.toml`, `exit-quic-direct.toml` | `quic`, with WireGuard over QUIC datagrams |
| `entry-kcp-reverse.toml`, `exit-kcp-reverse.toml` | `kcp` for a lossy link |
| `entry-gaming.toml`, `exit-gaming.toml` | a game server over `kcp` with the gaming profile |

A minimal reverse-mode pair:

```toml
# /etc/kariz/config.toml on the entry
role = "entry"
mode = "reverse"

[tunnel]
transport = "tcpmux"
listen = "0.0.0.0:3080"            # the exit connects here
token = "PASTE-THE-TOKEN"

[[forward]]
listen = "0.0.0.0:443"             # users connect here
target = "127.0.0.1:443"           # dialed by the exit
```

```toml
# /etc/kariz/config.toml on the exit
role = "exit"
mode = "reverse"

[tunnel]
transport = "tcpmux"
remote = "ENTRY_IP:3080"
token = "PASTE-THE-TOKEN"
```

`target` is resolved and dialed **on the exit**, so `127.0.0.1:443` means port 443 on
the exit server itself.

## 4. Check and run

```bash
kariz check -c /etc/kariz/config.toml    # validates, prints a summary and warnings
kariz run -c /etc/kariz/config.toml
```

Start the listening side first; the dialing side retries until it can connect either
way.

## 5. Run it as a service

```bash
sudo cp systemd/kariz.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable --now kariz
journalctl -u kariz -f
```

The unit reads `/etc/kariz/config.toml`, restarts Kariz if it stops, and grants the
capabilities for ports below 1024.
