# The manager script

`scripts/kariz.sh` installs Kariz and its [web panel](panel.md) on a Linux server with systemd,
and connects a server to a panel. After the first run it is also the `kariz-manager` command.

**Tunnels are not made here.** Servers, tunnels, private networks, backups and updates of the
other servers are all done in the web panel. The manager is only the way to get Kariz onto a
server and the panel running; from then on you work in the browser.

## Install

As root, on each server:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erfan-XRay/Kariz/main/scripts/kariz.sh)
```

The first time on a server it installs the Kariz core by itself, then asks what else this
server is for: only the core (tunnels are made from a panel on another server), the web panel
here as well, or a connection to a panel that exists. Every run after that opens a menu, with
the server's name and its IPv4 and IPv6 addresses at the top:

| | |
|---|---|
| **1** Install or update Kariz | finds your CPU (x86_64, aarch64 or armv7), downloads the latest release, checks its SHA-256 and its signature, and installs `kariz`, `kariz-panel`, the systemd units and the `kariz-manager` command |
| **2** Web panel and agent | install the panel on this server, make a login link, set a password, or connect this server to a panel with a join code |
| **3** Uninstall Kariz | stops and removes what it installed |

If GitHub limits your downloads (many servers behind one address), set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to any
personal access token before running the script: it is used only to lift that limit.

Other ways to install:

```bash
kariz-manager install --version v1.0.0        # a specific release
kariz-manager install --binary ./kariz        # a binary you built yourself
```

## The usual path

1. On the server that will hold the panel: run the one-liner, choose **2**, then **install**. It
   prints the panel's address and a one-time login link.
2. Open the link in a browser and sign in. From here on, work in the panel:
   [Using the panel](using-the-panel.md).
3. On every other server: run the one-liner and choose **2**, then **agent**, and paste the join
   code the panel gave you (Servers, Add server). That server now shows up in the panel.
4. Make tunnels in the panel, between any two of its servers.

## Commands

The menu and the commands do the same things:

```bash
kariz-manager install [--version vX.Y.Z] [--binary PATH]   # Kariz (and the panel program)
kariz-manager update [--version vX.Y.Z]                    # a new release; what runs is restarted
kariz-manager uninstall [--yes]                            # --yes also deletes the configs

kariz-manager panel install [--port N] [--host H] [--name NAME]   # the panel on this server: address, certificate, a login link; asks what to call this server (default: its host name)
kariz-manager panel name [NAME]                    # rename this server in the panel
kariz-manager panel link [--host H]                 # another one-time login link
kariz-manager panel password [--stdin | --random]  # a new admin password (asked twice, hidden)
kariz-manager panel status | logs                   # the service, its address / follow the log
kariz-manager panel uninstall [--yes]

kariz-manager --agent kz1_... [--yes]               # connect this server to a panel (the code is from the panel)
kariz-manager agent status | logs | remove
kariz-manager status                                # what runs here and this server's addresses
```

A server that already has an agent can be joined to another panel with a new code: the manager
says so, asks (`--yes` skips the question), removes the old agent, and starts the new one in its
place. The old panel keeps listing that server as offline until you remove it there.

## Update and uninstall

Opening the menu (and `kariz-manager status`) looks for a newer release. If one is out and the
core, the panel or the agent here is older, it says which and asks whether to update all of them
now. Joining a panel with `--agent CODE` updates an older program first, because an old agent
can refuse what a newer panel sends. `KARIZ_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` turns the look off. `update` also
fetches the newest `kariz-manager` script (unless you install from files of your own).

`install` and `update` check the release's **signature** (from 0.11, a release without a valid
one is not installed; older releases have none and are accepted with a warning) and its
SHA-256. `update` restarts what runs: every tunnel, the panel and the agent, so they use the
new binary. Once a server is connected to a panel, the panel can update it (and itself) with a
button: [Updating from the panel](panel.md#updating).

`update` does not replace the manager script itself. For a new version of the manager, fetch it
again:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/kariz-manager \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erfan-XRay/Kariz/main/scripts/kariz.sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kariz-manager
```

`uninstall` removes Kariz from the server completely: every tunnel, the agent (its service, its
identity and the private network links it made), the web panel if there is one, and the
programs. It lists what it will remove and asks once, then asks whether the tunnel configs and
the panel's data (tokens, servers, certificate) go too; `--yes` answers yes to everything. A
server that is connected to a panel keeps showing there as offline until you remove it in the
panel. `agent remove` removes only the agent.

## Logs

Kariz logs go to the journal, with systemd's priority for each line. The panel shows them in
its Logs page; on the server:

```bash
journalctl -u kariz@main -f                 # follow one tunnel
journalctl -u kariz@main -p warning         # only warnings and errors
journalctl -u kariz-panel -f                # the panel
journalctl -u kariz-agent -f                # the agent
```

## Good to know

- It needs root, systemd, and `curl` or `wget`.
- Tunnels are ordinary Kariz configs in `/etc/kariz/<name>.toml`, run by the service
  `kariz@<name>`; the panel's agent writes them. You can read them, and the
  [configuration reference](configuration.md) explains every setting, but change them in the
  panel so both sides stay in step.
- The service unit is `systemd/kariz@.service`.
